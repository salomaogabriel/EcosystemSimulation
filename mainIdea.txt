Main Idea:

Create a Working ecosystem simulation with PathFinding and mutations


TODOs:

Create Working Clock -
Create Grid - 
Create Animals
Use Dijkstra Algorithm in animals movement.
Create tools to modify simulation
Create Charts about the simulation

How the genes will work:
Using Genetic Algorithm
Every skill of an animal will be represented by a binary value

When mating, a random crossover point will be selected from the genes.
Eg:
Parent1 : | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
Parent2 : | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

A random crossover point could be the 4th gene.
The offSpring would be the result of 
offSpring1 : | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
offSpring2 : | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

(The child offSpring "Order" will be selected randomly)

After that, there might occur a mutation in a gene, but its not likely, low random probability.

Eg:
Before Mutation
Genes : | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
After Mutation
Genes : | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

**The selection will be decided by the ecosystem itself.
